I am conducting research on the limitations of LLMs in task-specific performance and developing methodologies to enhance their adaptability for specialized tasks. My work spans the fields of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning efficacy.

 I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [National University of Science and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/) in 2024, where I worked under supervision of [Dr. Faisal Shafait](https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/members/faisal_shafait.html). Prior to this, I completed a research internship at [CERN](https://home.cern/) during the summer of 2023 and worked with [Dr. Adrian Ulges](https://www.cs.hs-rm.de/~ulges/) at RheinMain University of Applied Sciences in the summer of 2022 .
