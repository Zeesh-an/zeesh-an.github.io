I am Zeeshan Memon, a final-year computer science student at the National University of Science and Technology in Islamabad, Pakistan. As I approach the culmination of my undergraduate journey, I am enthusiastically seeking opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge research in the realm of deep learning and computer vision.

In the past two years, I have immersed myself in applying state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to real-world challenges. During my tenure at CERN, I contributed to the development of foundational models for particle shower simulation, using vector quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE). Previously, I collaborated with Dr. Adrian Ulges and Ulrich Schwanecke on a DAAD-funded project, where we focused on pioneering unsupervised super-resolution techniques for satellite imagery using autoencoders fusing two modalities images. Additionally, I dedicated two years to collaborating with Deep Learning Lab(DLL) SEECS, contributing to the development of OCR systems for low-resource language, and also published my work at International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition on Urdu handwriting generation utilizing GANs and novel recognition loss.
